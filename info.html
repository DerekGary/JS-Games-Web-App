    <h1>Minesweeper Information</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Minesweeper! This page provides an overview of the game and instructions on how to play.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on a square to reveal what's underneath it.</li>
        <li>If a number appears, it indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square.</li>
        <li>Use the numbers to deduce the location of mines and mark them with flags.</li>
        <li>The game is won when all squares without mines are uncovered.</li>
        <li>Be careful! If you click on a square containing a mine, you lose the game.</li>
    </ol>
