            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Minesweeper game is a classic puzzle game that originated in the 1960s. It was popularized by Microsoft when it was included in the Windows operating system starting from Windows 3.1.</p>
            <p>The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. The board is divided into cells, and each cell may contain either a mine or a number indicating the number of mines in adjacent cells.</p>
            <p>The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed. However, if a player clicks on a cell containing a mine, the game is lost.</p>
            <p>Enjoy playing Minesweeper!</p>
