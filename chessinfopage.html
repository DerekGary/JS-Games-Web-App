                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Chess is a classic board game that has been played for centuries. It is believed to have originated
                    in India during the Gupta Empire, around the 6th century AD. Since then, it has spread globally
                    and evolved into various forms.</p>
                <p>The game is played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard, with each player starting with 16 pieces:
                    one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</p>
                <p>The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is in a position to be
                    captured (in check) and there is no way to remove the threat (checkmate).</p>
                <p>Enjoy playing Chess!</p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>To play Chess, follow these instructions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Each player starts with their pieces arranged on the two rows closest to them.</li>
                    <li>White moves first, then players take turns moving one piece at a time.</li>
                    <li>Each type of piece moves differently, and capturing an opponent's piece is done by moving to
                        its square.</li>
                    <li>The game ends when one player achieves checkmate, stalemate, or resignation.</li>
                    <li>Checkmate is achieved when the opponent's king is in a position to be captured with no legal
                        moves to escape.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Good luck!</p>
